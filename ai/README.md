# Running the Agouti AI Model Training Script

Run the IPython Notebook in this repo on Google Colab to train your own AI model. After Colab has finished execution, download the following two files from Colab:

- `metadata.json`
- `toplayer.tflite`

You can then put these into the [`rpi`](../rpi/) directory, and replace our pre-existing files there.

If you do not wish to train your own model, you can use our existing model. That is already available in the [`rpi`](../rpi/) directory when you clone this repo.
